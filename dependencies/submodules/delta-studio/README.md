## Building the Code

As this codebase is currently not ready for release, I can't make any guarantees about whether it will build for you. However, the process is pretty straightforward for anyone who wants to try:

1. Install Python 3 (if you don't have it already)
2. Clone the *Delta Studio* repository
3. Open ```project/delta-studio.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
4. Build the solution
5. Run the ```delta-basic-demo``` project

That should be all! Assuming your computer has OpenGL 4 or DirectX11 support, the game window should open immediately.

**You are now ready to begin development!**
